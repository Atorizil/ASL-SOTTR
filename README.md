Load Removal for Shadow of the Tomb Raider

## Use
1. In **LiveSplit**, **Right Click** anywhere and click **Edit Layout**
2. **Click +**, **Control, Scriptable Auto Splitter**
3. **Browse** and choose the **.asl  File Downloaded**
4. Make sure you're comparing against **Game Time** for **splits** and **timer**

## Problems
- Cutscenes don't work for everything:
  - Near the end of Trial of the Eagle, Spike Deaths don't remove time

<!--
# Todo
-  Make this a Auto Splitter aswell as Load Removal
- Settings:
  - Skippable & Unskippable Cutscenes
    - Improve Cutscene Addresses
-->

## For Reference (Version Numbers)
The first number means the game update. So V2 is the next game update after V1 and so on...

The second number after the decimal means the script version for that game update
